A simple calculator made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## General Info
This calculator was made during the third week of my _nology course where we were taught how to use arrow functions and event listeners to interact with objects on the webpage (DOM).
I made this iPhone calculator clone using vanilla JavaScript. Using DOM manipulation I was able to create a fully functioning calculator that handles basic arithmetic.
